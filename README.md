#Brief about protractor.
Protractor is an end-to-end (e2e) javascript automation testing framework. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would. Protractor is built on top of WebDriverJS, which uses native events and browser-specific drivers to interact with your application as a user would. Protractor supports Angular-specific locator strategies, which allows you to test Angular-specific elements without any setup effort on your part. You no longer need to add waits and sleeps to your test. Protractor can automatically execute the next step in your test the moment the webpage finishes pending tasks, so you donâ€™t have to worry about waiting for your test and webpage to sync.
